# NEW MECHANICS

## UNIVERSAL

- LLPC
- Max airdodge landing lag 20f -> 12f
- Min airdodge landing lag 10 -> 8f
- Airdodge sling distance is now negative 4 -> -5
- Airdodge landing speed multiplier altered 0.85 -> 5 (this just maxes it for every character)

## SPECIFIC

The moves and characters these changes effects are documented in each characters "new mechanics" section in their changelog

- Some aerials can now be hitfalled
- Most down airs can be cancelled into any special move or other aerials upon hitting a player (not shield)
    - As many recoveries raw distances have been nerfed and the global DI multiplier has increased, many down airs have had knockback overall nerfed
    - This means spiking and KOing people incredibly early offstage will be harder, but they can be repurposed for creative combos and setups
