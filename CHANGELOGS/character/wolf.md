# ABOUT

Wolf is already pretty cool. I wanted to make him cooler. The main focus is his special moves, all of which will be rekitted with new functionility giving wolf new options, albeit mainly once already in advantage state. He's also got the typical jump cancel shine as well as some blaster buffs as expected, being the true token spacie rep for this mod

# NEW MECHANICS

- Hitfall up air
- Jump cancel the first hit of neutral B on hit
- Jump cancel shine after its hitbox comes out
- Dair cancelling

# CHANGELOG

- Up air
    - Hits slightly closer to the ground and comes out a frame faster


# IN PROGRESS



# PLANNED CHANGES
