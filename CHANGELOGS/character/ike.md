# ABOUT

Ike's new movement ability enables him to cancel quick draw with a jump, conserving some of his momentum in the process. This is a massive buff to recovery, and gives him incredible mixups thanks to b reverses and wavedashes, and comes alongside various other changes to allow him to compete better with the cast, such as jab and grab buffs. However, while his movement may be considerably better now, he still lacks fast options to cover himself, especially in the air, meaning one must be careful in the situations they place themselves in, furthermore, if quick draw meets shield or whiffs, he is unable to cancel it at all.
