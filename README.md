# ABOUT

An (un)balanced mod based on random suggestions from smash Twitter. Your main could be fun as hell now. Or a lot worse. Or maybe just completely broken! I'm mainly doing this to familiarise myself with Ultimate modding in case I ever want to do something seriously in the future.

# CHANGELOG

Written in alphabetical order as I cba to look up roster order by the way

## Key

- [*] = not showcased on my twitter and i plan to do so (this label is mainly for myself)
- [!] = overtuned change that definately unbalances the character

- [=] = literally just fixxing something not in vanilla
