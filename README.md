## ABOUT

A mod that cuts down the SSBU cast down to a significantly smaller portion (8-12 characters) with the aim to rekit them to be more flashy and fun to watch.

Will feature tweaks to the DI system and extra movement options, and plenty of character specific tech.

## CHANGELOG

The changelogs of each character and element will be saved in the changelog folder. Please note any changes in the "planned changes" or "in progress" sections are subject to change as things such as technical capability and balance come into play. 

I'll make a google doc compiling the changes if people find this system hard to read, but its much easier for me to manage individual markdown files.

## INSTALLING

Requires **libsmashline_hook.nro** and **libnro_hook.nro**. Install like any other mod. This mod can be toggled with the built in arc mod manager.
