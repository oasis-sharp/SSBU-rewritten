## ABOUT

A mod that cuts down the SSBU cast down to a significantly smaller portion (8-12 characters) with the aim to rekit them to be more flashy and fun to watch.

Will feature tweaks to the DI system and extra movement options, and plenty of character specific tech.

## CHANGELOG

The changelogs of each character and element will be saved to the changelog folder.

## INSTALLING

Install like any other mod but keep in mind this requires smashline and libnro installed, and is untested with other mods of a similar type. Should generally work with skin mods though, including wifi-unsafe mods (this may be subject to change)
